    <h2>Our Creative Thinking Process</h2>
    <p>Our team discussed about who was  working on each article first, so that we would be ready with the information needed for the table on the one we went with. We made a wireframe to plan out & Brainstorm ideas on how we'd format the pages and place in the information onto each page.</p>  

    <h2>Distribtuion of Work</h2>
    <p>We first knew that we each would do a webpage on our article. After that, two of us was working on the basics of our page. For instance, the group banner, the colors we would decide to use for our palette, and overall, how we would organize our page. This is where our wireframe came in to play.</p>

    <h2>Proud accomplishments</h2>
    <p> The thing we were most proud of was finally getting our CSS to work. At first, it was having some issues displaying correctly, but after some troubleshooting, it finally worked. </p>

    <h2>Difficult Challenges</h2>
    <p>The thing that was the most difficult for us was putting in the table, as sometimes it would bug out. To elaborate, for one of us, it was extremely difficult figuring out the sizing. When playing around with the code to make it work, it would either not extened large enough to fill up the width of the screen, or be too small for the width of the screen.</p>
